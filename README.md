## Immigration - Human Rights - Children - Latin America

I am a DPhil (PhD) student in Migration Studies at the University of Oxford. My research examines the long-term impacts of immigration on the educational outcomes of US-born students. 

Before Oxford I worked with IOM, the United Nations migration agency, evaluating the living conditions and needs of migrants on the US - Mexico border. In the past, I have carried out extensive research on the aspiration and expectation-building processes of Central American immigrants en-route to the U.S.

I am a big data nerd, completely obsessed with pragmatic and impact-driven research ideas.
